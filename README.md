## 1.ABSTRACT:
The development of autonomous driving relies significantly on high-quality datasets that meet strict requirements for both sensors and variations in external conditions. Currently, there is a pressing need for abundant, diverse, and realistic datasets to drive advancements in autonomous driving technology. In this paper, we present a multi-sensor dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving. It incorporates advanced sensors such as a 128-beam Lidar, solid-state Lidar, and event cameras. It not only provides precise trajectory ground truth for localization tasks but also offers real-time driver behavior for research in domains such as reinforcement learning. To ensure that the dataset reflects the real world, we took into account variations in lighting conditions, weather, and pedestrian flow. This deliberate inclusion aims to provide challenging scenarios for researchers to comprehensively evaluate and enhance the performance of autonomous driving algorithms. Through this dataset, researchers can delve deeper into the challenges faced by autonomous driving technology, thereby driving innovation and progress in the field.
